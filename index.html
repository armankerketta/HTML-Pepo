        In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering.
        Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in
        particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the 
        means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become 
        dependent on fruits as a source of food.Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's 
        agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic 
        meanings.

            In common language usage, fruit normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that 
            typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and 
            strawberries. In botanical usage, the term fruit also includes many structures that are not commonly called 'fruits' 
            in everyday language, such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.

            Dried fruit is fruit from which the majority of the original water content has been removed either naturally, through
             sun drying, or through the use of specialized dryers or dehydrators. Dried fruit has a long tradition of use dating 
             back to the fourth millennium BC in Mesopotamia, and is prized because of its sweet taste, nutritive value, and long 
             shelf life.
            Today, dried fruit consumption is widespread. Nearly half of the dried fruits sold are raisins, followed by dates, 
            prunes, figs, apricots, peaches, apples, and pears.[1] These are referred to as "conventional" or "traditional" dried 
            fruits: fruits that have been dried in the sun or in heated wind tunnel dryers. Many fruits such as cranberries, 
            blueberries, cherries, strawberries, and mango are infused with a sweetener (e.g. sucrose syrup) prior to drying. 
            Some products sold as dried fruit, like papaya, kiwifruit and pineapple, are most often candied fruit.

                    Dates are high in fiber and antioxidants. Their nutritional benefits may support brain health and prevent disease.
                    Dates are the fruit of the date palm tree, which is grown in many tropical regions of the world. Dates have become 
                    quite popular in recent years.

                    peach, (Prunus persica), fruit tree of the rose family (Rosaceae) grown throughout the warmer temperate regions of 
                    both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Peaches are widely eaten fresh and are also baked in pies and cobblers; 
                    canned peaches are a staple commodity in many regions. Yellow-fleshed varieties are especially rich in vitamin A.
