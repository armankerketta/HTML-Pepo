        A car or an automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run 
        primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not 
        cargo.French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, 
        while French-born-Swiss inventor Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal 
        combustion powered automobile in 1808.
