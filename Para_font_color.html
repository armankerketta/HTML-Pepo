        A car or an automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run 
        primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not 
        cargo.French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, 
        while French-born-Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal 
        combustion powered automobile in 1808.

        The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when German 
        inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during 
        the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car 
        manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn 
        carriages. In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World 
        War II. The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.

        Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, 
        additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. 
        These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. 
        Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fuelled by the 
        combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became 
        commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 
        2025. The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate 
        change mitigation scenarios,such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.
