    <h1>Internet of Things</h1>
    <p1>
        The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, 
        processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other 
        devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks. The Internet of things 
        (IoT) falls under the Electronics & Communication and Computer Science Engineering. Internet of 
        things has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public 
        internet, they only need to be connected to a network, and be individually addressable.

        The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous 
        computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, as well as machine learning.
        Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation 
        (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things.
        In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of 
        the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home 
        security systems, cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, 
        and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart 
        speakers. IoT is also used in healthcare systems.
