    <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
    <hr>

        <h2>What is AI</h2>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by computers, as opposed to <em>human or animal
    intelligence</em>. "Intelligence" encompasses the ability to learn and to reason, to generalize, and to 
    infer meaning. AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), 
    recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as 
    <em>Siri and Alexa</em>), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), 
    automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess 
    and Go).

    Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has 
    experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding 
    (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding. AI research has 
    tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem 
    solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades 
    of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and 
    this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout 
    industry and academia.

    The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular 
    tools. <strong>The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, 
        learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.</strong> 
    General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.
    To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving 
    techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, 
    and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, 
    psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.

    The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a 
    machine can be made to simulate it". This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the 
    ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues 
    have previously been explored by myth, fiction (science fiction), and philosophy since antiquity. 
    Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to 
    humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards goals beneficial to humankind. Economists 
    have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if 
    there is no adequate social policy for full employment. The term artificial intelligence has also 
    been criticized for overhyping AI's true technological capabilities.
